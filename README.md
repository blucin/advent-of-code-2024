# Advent of Code 2024

This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges. Initially solved in Elixir, but due to time constraints, I switched to Python for the remaining solutions :P

> [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

### How to run

1. Install the [Mix build tool](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.12/Mix.html).
2. Download your own input or get one from the test cases and save it to `lib/inputs/` or into your preferred location.
3. Run it using
```bash
$ mix dayXX <input_file_path>
# e.g. mix day01 lib/inputs/day01.txt
```
